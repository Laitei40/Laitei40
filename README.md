👋 Hi, I’m @Laitei40
👀 I’m interested in linguistics, web development, open-source contributions, and language preservation—especially for the Mara language.
🌱 I am growing myself in React, Python, and language technology (like Common Voice, TTS, and NLP).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on localization, minority language tech projects, and tools that support underrepresented communities.
📫 How to reach me: laiteipara@gmail.com
😄 Pronouns: he/him
⚡ Fun fact: I’m building a Mara encyclopedia, helping my community with tech, and creating tools that bridge tradition and technology!
